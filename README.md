# Satisfactory Factories
This [web tool](https://satisfactory-factories.app/) is designed to help players of the video game Satisfactory&trade; to plan a comprehensive production chain.

The tool highlights bottlenecks in the production chain, and visually tells the player that they have a problem within their designs.

The player can scale up end product factories as they see fit, and check if their production chain can handle the increased load.
