# Contributions to Satisfactory Factories

Hello and thank you for your interest in contributing to Satisfactory Factories! We are excited to have you here and appreciate your help in making this project better.

## How to Contribute
Contributions are most welcome!

### Getting Started
Please read `README.md` and the documents contained within the `/docs` folder to get started on local development.

### Development cycle
Please follow this guide to make sure your contributions are as effective as possible:

1. Check if there is already an issue open for what you want to change. **Please do not start work without an attached issue!**
    1. If there is one, please comment on it to let us know you are working on it.
2. If there is not one, please open a new issue.
    1. Clearly describe the issue you are experiencing or the feature you are wanting to add.
    2. If you are able to, please provide a UI mockup to really get your point across.
3. Fork the repository.
4. Create a new branch for your changes.
5. Open a draft pull request on the main repo. This is to indicate to other contributors that you are working on this issue.
6. Make your changes.
7. Ideally write tests for your changes (remember, they are mandatory within the Parser project).
8. Await the review cycle and make changes.
9. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main branch and deployed.

## How to gain Contributor / Active Developer status
Once you have submitted and have had merged some PRs, a judgement call will be made by @Maelstromeous to invite you to the Satisfactory Factories organisation. Being a member of said organisation means you no longer need to fork the repository and can push directly to the main repository.

## Communication and Decision Making
Please keep in mind that this is a hobby project designed around a game, and it is intentionally chill, but maintaining some standards. We are all here to have fun and learn new things and build a tool to make our lives playing Satisfactory easier. Please be respectful and kind to your fellow contributors. We are all here to learn and grow together!

There is no true democracy when it comes to software projects (some may say... Managed Democracy?). The project creator (@Maelstromeous) has the final say on all decisions. If you disagree with a decision, please bring it up in a respectful manner, he is a reasonable guy!

The preferred method of communication is through [Discord](https://discord.gg/abXGXHnE), with decision points being recorded within the GitHub issue itself.
